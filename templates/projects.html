        <p>One of my first projects, a discord bot with no real scope. I just threw a bunch of stuff as I kept exploring
            how Python works, and getting familiar with it. It does your usual stuff like bans, logs, and whatever else
            I felt like adding over the years. I encourage you add it to your server, and run the
            <dashed>db.help</dashed> command to actually explore all of its features.

        <p>I <i>maintain*</i> a handful of snippets and code examples for the {{links.dpy()}} library, an API wrapper
            for
            discord. I've created these over the years, simply for them to be shared in the {{links.dpy_inv()}}, where I
            am staff.</p>

                Shows how to use an <i>extremely basic</i> CLI entrypoint for a python script. In this case, for syncing
