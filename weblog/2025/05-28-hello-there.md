# Hello there!

Well, i've gone and made a blog-style space on my website... Now what? I guess I
should write about stuff that happens in my life, or random things that happen
to interest me. Yeah, I think I'll do just that.

But first and foremost, I'd like to add that I have a messy writing style, which
stems from a combination of ADHD and being first and foremost a romance language
speaker. I make up words sometimes, or type weird things. Hopefully you find
that funny, but if you do notice something weird or wrong, I would love if you
sent me an email or let me know in any way. ([contact me](/#contacts))
